# ProceduralMeshes
Procedural mesh generation codes, that should be used in editor but not at runtime, as they're not very optimized. They do work at runtime, but keep in mind that these have not been for that.

The objective with this project is to have a meshes database, with dynamic parameters, making them more flexible than Unity's native meshes, and adding some shapes.

Meshes included :
- Circle
- Cone
- Cube
- Cylinder
- Plane
- Ring
- Torus
